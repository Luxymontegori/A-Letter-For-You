My Dearest, Helga

I couldnâ€™t sleep tonight.
The hours feel longer than usual, and my mind keeps wandering â€” to us, to the little things, to everything I never quite say out loud.
Itâ€™s quiet here, but my thoughts havenâ€™t stopped since the day began.

Itâ€™s strange how a single memory can replay itself over and over.
Like how you used to say my name when you were excited, or how youâ€™d talk about your day with that light in your voice.
I still think about those things when the night feels too still â€” they remind me of a version of us that feels untouched by time.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been caught in my own head more than I should be.
Not in a bad way â€” just... wondering, maybe overthinking a little too much.
Sometimes I worry that one day, someone else might make you laugh the way I used to.
That maybe youâ€™ll find a comfort in someone new, and Iâ€™ll slowly fade into a quiet part of your story.
Itâ€™s not jealousy, really â€” itâ€™s fear.
The kind that comes from caring too much, from loving something so deeply that losing it feels unthinkable.

Still, I donâ€™t say it. I just carry it quietly.
Because I donâ€™t want those thoughts to make things heavy between us.
So I write them here instead, where they can live without changing anything.

Youâ€™re still the thought that finds its way into everything â€” songs, random moments, even the way I see the night sky.
Iâ€™ve realized that loving you has become part of how I exist; itâ€™s not something I switch off when we say goodbye.

I know weâ€™re both trying â€” to grow, to stay strong, to believe in what weâ€™ve built.
And even though I sometimes fall into my own doubts, I never stop being grateful for you.
For your patience, your warmth, and the quiet way you make everything feel a little easier just by being there.

So tonight, like every other night I canâ€™t sleep, Iâ€™ll think of you â€”
and hope that somewhere in your world, you still think of me too.

Love,
Reyhan
